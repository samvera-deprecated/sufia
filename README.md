# Creating a Sufia-based app

## Prerequisites

Sufia requires the following software to work:

1. Solr
1. [Fedora Commons](http://www.fedora-commons.org/) digital repository
1. A SQL RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL), though **note** that SQLite will be used by default if you're looking to get up and running quickly
1. [Redis](http://redis.io/), a key-value store
1. [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) with JPEG-2000 support
1. [FITS](#characterization) version 0.6.x
1. [LibreOffice](#derivatives)

**NOTE: If you do not already have Solr and Fedora instances you can use in your development environment, you may use hydra-jetty (instructions are provided below to get you up and running quickly and with minimal hassle).**

### Characterization

1. Go to http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/downloads and download a copy of FITS (be sure to get version 0.6.2) & unpack it somewhere on your machine.
1. Mark fits.sh as executable (`chmod a+x fits.sh`)
1. Run "fits.sh -h" from the command line and see a help message to ensure FITS is properly installed
1. Give your Sufia app access to FITS by:
    1. Adding the full fits.sh path to your PATH (e.g., in your .bash_profile), **OR**
    1. Changing `config/initializers/sufia.rb` to point to your FITS location:  `config.fits_path = "/<your full path>/fits.sh"`

### Derivatives

Install [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). If `which soffice` returns a path, you're done. Otherwise, add the full path to soffice to your PATH (in your .bash_profile, for instance). On OSX, soffice is **inside** LibreOffice.app. Your path may look like "/<your full path to>/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/"

## Environments

Note here that the following commands assume you're setting up Sufia in a development environment (using the Rails built-in development environment). If you're setting up a production or production-like environment, you may wish to tell Rails that by prepending `RAILS_ENV=production` to the commands that follow, e.g., `rails`, `rake`, `bundle`, and so on.

## Ruby

First, you'll need a working Ruby installation. You can install this via your operating system's package manager -- you are likely to get farther with OSX, Linux, or UNIX than Windows but your mileage may vary -- but we recommend using a Ruby version manager such as [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv).

We recommend either Ruby 2.2 or the latest 2.1 version.

## Rails

Generate a new Rails application.  We recommend either Rails 4.2 or the latest 4.1 version.

```
gem install rails -v '>=4.2'
rails new my_app
```

## Sufia's Ruby-related dependencies

Add the following lines to your application's Gemfile.

```
gem 'sufia', '6.0.0'
gem 'kaminari', github: 'jcoyne/kaminari', branch: 'sufia'  # required to handle pagination properly in dashboard. See https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari/pull/322
```

Then install Sufia as a dependency of your app via `bundle install`

### Pagination

The line with kaminari -- a Ruby library that helps build pagination into applications -- listed as a dependency in the Gemfile is a temporary fix to address a
[known problem](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari/pull/322) in the current release of kaminari.

## Install Sufia

Install Sufia into your app using its built-in install generator. This step adds a number of files that Sufia requires within your Rails app, including e.g. a number of database migrations.

```
rails generate sufia:install -f
```

## Database tables and indexes

Now that Sufia's required database migrations have been generated into your app, you'll need to load them into your application's database.

```
rake db:migrate
```

## Solr and Fedora

If you already have instances of Solr and Fedora that you would like to use, you may skip this step. Otherwise feel free to use the bundled copy of Jetty, a Java servlet container that is configured to run versions of Solr and Fedora that are known to work with Sufia.

```
rake jetty:clean
rake sufia:jetty:config
rake jetty:start
```

## Start background workers

Sufia uses a queuing system named Resque to manage long-running or slow processes. Resque relies on the [redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store, so [redis](http://redis.io/) must be installed *and running* on your system in order for background workers to pick up jobs.

Unless redis has already been started, you will want to start it up. You can do this either by calling the `redis-server` command, or if you're on certain Linuxes, you can do this via `sudo service redis-server start`.

Next you will need to spawn Resque's workers. The following command will run until you stop it, so you may want to do this in a dedicated terminal.

```
QUEUE=* rake environment resque:work
```

Or, if you prefer (e.g., in production-like environments), you may want to set up a `config/resque-pool.yml` -- [here is a simple example](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/blob/master/sufia-models/lib/generators/sufia/models/templates/config/resque-pool.yml) -- and run resque-pool which will manage your background workers in a dedicated process.

```
resque-pool --daemon --environment development start
```

See https://github.com/defunkt/resque for more options. If you do wind up using resque-pool, you might also be interested in a shell script to help manage it. [Here is an example](https://github.com/psu-stewardship/scholarsphere/blob/develop/script/restart_resque.sh) which you can adapt for your needs.

## Audiovisual transcoding

Sufia includes support for transcoding audio and video files.  To enable this, make sure to have ffmpeg > 1.0 installed.

On OSX, you can use homebrew for this.

```
brew install ffmpeg --with-fdk-aac --with-libvpx --with-libvorbis
```

To compile ffmpeg yourself, see https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide

## User interface

**Remove** turbolinks support from `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` if present:

```
//= require turbolinks
```

Turbolinks causes the dynamic content editor not to load.

## Integration with Dropbox, Box, etc.

Sufia provides built-in support for the [browse-everything](https://github.com/projecthydra/browse-everything) gem, which provides a consolidated file picker experience for selecting files from [DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com),
[Skydrive](https://skydrive.live.com/), [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com),
[Box](http://www.box.com), and a server-side directory share.

To activate browse-everything in your sufia app, run the browse-everything config generator

```
rails g browse_everything:config
```

This will generate a file at _config/browse_everything_providers.yml_. Open that file and enter the API keys for the providers that you want to support in your app.  For more info on configuring browse-everything, go to the [project page](https://github.com/projecthydra/browse-everything) on github.

After running the browse-everything config generator and setting the API keys for the desired providers, an extra tab will appear in your app's Upload page allowing users to pick files from those providers and submit them into your app's repository.

**If your config/initializers/sufia.rb was generated with sufia 3.7.2 or earlier**, then you need to add this line to an initializer (probably _config/initializers/sufia.rb _):
```ruby
config.browse_everything = BrowseEverything.config
```

## Analytics and usage statistics

Sufia provides support for capturing usage information via Google Analytics and for displaying usage stats in the UI.

### Capturing usage

To enable the Google Analytics javascript snippet, make sure that `config.google_analytics_id` is set in your app within the `config/initializers/sufia.rb` file. A Google Analytics ID typically looks like _UA-99999999-1_.

### Displaying usage in the UI

To display data from Google Analytics in the UI, first head to the Google Developers Console and create a new project:

https://console.developers.google.com/project

Let's assume for now Google assigns it a project ID of _foo-bar-123_. It may take a few seconds for this to complete (watch the Activities bar near the bottom of the browser).  Once it's complete, enable the Google+ and Google Analytics APIs here (note: this is an example URL -- you'll have to change the project ID to match yours):

https://console.developers.google.com/project/apps~foo-bar-123/apiui/api

Finally, head to this URL (note: this is an example URL -- you'll have to change the project ID to match yours):

https://console.developers.google.com/project/apps~foo-bar-537/apiui/credential

And create a new OAuth client ID.  When prompted for the type, use the "Service Account" type.  This will give you the OAuth client ID, a client email address, a private key file, a private key secret/password, which you will need in the next step.

Then run this generator:

```
rails g sufia:models:usagestats
```

The generator will create a configuration file at _config/analytics.yml_.  Edit that file to reflect the information that the Google Developer Console gave you earlier, namely you'll need to provide it:

* The path to the private key
* The password/secret for the privatekey
* The OAuth client email
* An application name (you can make this up)
* An application version (you can make this up)

Lastly, you will need to set `config.analytics = true` and `config.analytic_start_date` in _config/initializers/sufia.rb_ and ensure that the OAuth client email
has the proper access within your Google Analyics account.  To do so, go to the _Admin_ tab for your Google Analytics account.
Click on _User Management_, in the _Account_ column, and add "Read & Analyze" permissions for the OAuth client email address.

## Tag Cloud

Sufia provides a tag cloud on the home page.  To change which field is displayed in that cloud, change the value of `config.tag_cloud_field_name` in the `blacklight_config` section of your CatalogController.  For example:

```ruby
configure_blacklight do |config|
  ...

  # Specify which field to use in the tag cloud on the homepage.
  # To disable the tag cloud, comment out this line.
  config.tag_cloud_field_name = Solrizer.solr_name("tag", :facetable)
end
```

If your CatalogController was generated by a version of Sufia older than 3.7.3 you need to add that line to the Nlacklight configuration in order to make the tag cloud appear.

The contents of the cloud are retrieved as JSON from Blacklight's CatalogController#facet method.  If you need to change how that content is returned (ie. if you need to limit the number of results), override the `render_facet_list_as_json` method in your CatalogController.

## Customizing metadata

Chances are you will want to customize the default metadata provided by Sufia.  Here's [a guide](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/wiki/Customizing-Metadata) to help you with that

## Proxies and Transfers (Sufia 4.x only)

To add proxies and transfers to your **Sufia 4**-based app, run the 'sufia:models:proxies' generator and then run 'rake db:migrate'.  If you're already running Sufia 5 or 6, this is already added and you may skip this step.

## Admin Users

### One time setup for first admin

Follow the directions for installing hydra-role-management.

Add the following gem to Sufia installed app's Gemfile
```
gem "hydra-role-management"
```

### Adding an admin user

In rails console, run the following commands to create the admin role.
```
r = Role.create name: "admin"
```

Add a user as the admin.
```
r.users << User.find_by_user_key( "your_admin_users_email@fake.email.org" )
r.save
```

Confirm user was made an admin.
```
u = User.find_by_user_key( "your_admin_users_email@fake.email.org" )
u.admin?
  # shows SELECT statment
 => true

if u.admin? == true then SUCCESS
```

Confirm in browser

* go to your Sufia install
* login as the admin user
* add /roles to the end of the main URL

SUCCESS will look like...

* you don't get an error on the /roles page
* you see a button labeled "Create a new role"

# Contributing

We'd love to accept your contributions.  Please see our guide to [contributing to Sufia](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Development

This information is for people who want to modify the engine itself, not an application that uses the engine:

## Regenerating the README TOC

[Install the gh-md-toc tool](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc/blob/master/README.md#installation), then ensure your README changes are up on GitHub, and then run:

`gh-md-toc https://github.com/USERNAME/sufia/blob/BRANCH/README.md`

That will print to stdout the new TOC, which you can copy into `README.md`, commit, and push.

## Run the test suite

The test suite also requires [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), version 1.9.x.

```
rake jetty:start
redis-server
rake engine_cart:clean
rake engine_cart:generate
rake spec
```

## Change validation behavior

To change what happens to files that fail validation add an after_validation hook
```
    after_validation :dump_infected_files

    def dump_infected_files
      if Array(errors.get(:content)).any? { |msg| msg =~ /A virus was found/ }
        content.content = errors.get(:content)
        save
      end
    end
```
